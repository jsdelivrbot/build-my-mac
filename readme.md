# üîß Welcome to My Mac-Maker üíª

This is, yet another, dev environment start-up script.
My goal here is to break down the particular items being installed into individual modules.
Each module is then sourced from the main *install.sh* script with `source ./run/[MODULE]/setup`.
This makes it real easy to remove anything you do not want without worry of breaking other parts of this build.
Likewise, this structure lends itself to being extended with any modules of your own.

## Project Organization

The *install.sh* script is what will be run upon executing the start-up command listed below.
This script will get Brew up and running on your machine üçª.
The Brewfile will install a number of binarys, libraries and applications durring the Brew install process.
It is recommended that you look over this file and the supporting *brew-casks* and *brew-mas* files to customize the setup to your liking. Any applications that are paid apps must be purchased with the apple id you are using before running the script.
Note that Xcode is one of the items included in the `mas` bundle.
It has been isolated to its own *xcode-install* file as a convenience to allow for an optional install durring run time,
due to its hell-ishly long install times ‚è∞.

After the Brew process is finished the *install.sh* script will begin to source the individual system modules to be installed.
If you do not wish to have a particular module installed on your machine simply delete,
or comment out, the line in the *install.sh* script where it is sourced.

All modules are organized together in the **run** üìÇ.
In each of their respective directories lives a *setup* script, which is what is sourced in the main *install.sh* script.
Some of the individual modules have additional dotfiles or supporting scripts files.
These may be files that will be symlinked into your **HOME** üìÇ,
provided as alternative install options, further modularization, or organizational purposes.
For example in the *zsh* module both *antigen* (my personal preference) and *oh-my-zsh* are included (pick your ‚ò†).

## Install Instructions

### üíæ Download...

Run the following commands:

```sh
curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/thacherT1D/mac-maker/tarball --create-dirs -o ~/Projects/dotfiles.tar.gz
```

Pulls down tar file of this repo onto your machine while creating a */Projects* directory.

```sh
tar -zxvf ~/Projects/dotfiles.tar.gz -C ~/Projects/
```

Moves into */Projects* directory and untars the tar downlaoded file.

```sh
cd ~/Projects && mv thacherT1D* dotfiles
```

Changes the name of the untared directory from "MrJadaml-mac-maker-[SHA]" to "dotfiles"

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Personalize...

Once the project is copied I suggest you rummage through it and make any modifications to suit your personal preferences.

There is an optional Brew mas setup for Apple Store apps that you will be prompted about durring installation.
Please have your email and password for the Apple Store ready.

### üìù Install...

Be sure you are in the *dotfiles* directory.

```
cd ~/Projects/dotfiles
```

Then run the following command into your terminal:

```
source install.sh
```

When it promts you to enter your password, be sure to check if it is asking for your computer password or your appleID password.

#### Accept Xcode Agreement

To accept the Xcode agreement from the terminal, run the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

##### Powerline fonts config

In iTerm, move to the Text options by selecting iTerm2 > Preferences > Profile > Text
In the Text preferences pane, enable the "Use a different font for non-ASCII text" option.
Then change the font to one of Powerline options. 13pt Cousine is a good choice.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some of the settings require the system to be logged out and back in before taking effect.
